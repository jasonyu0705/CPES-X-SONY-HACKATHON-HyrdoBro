# CPES-X-SONY-HACKATHON-HyrdoBro
## HydroBro
This project was developed by a team of two during the CPESxSONY Hackathon in 2025 ,with the theme to create a solution that would improve daily life. We decided to design and build a robot that tackles a common issue: remembering to stay hydratedðŸ’§. Our robot, which we have named 	*HydroBro* , kindly reminds you periodically to take some drinks of water and to take a walk with a cheerful tune and flashing lights, helping you stay hydrated and active throughout the day. HydroBro can sense whether a water bottle was placed on its right side and wont stop playing the tune and flashing light's until the water bottle is picked up , ensuring that you wont forget to take that much-needed sip of water (*ï¼¾-ï¼¾*ï¼‰.

### How it was made
For this project we used the [Sony Spresense main board](https://developer.sony.com/spresense) along with its extension board to power our robot. The development was done using the Arduino IDE for easy set up and control over the various components used in this project
**Key Components**
- Sony spresense main board + extension board
- 16x2 LCD
- LED's
- Piezo buzzer
- Ultrasonic Sonar Distance Sensor
- Potentiometer
- 2x 560â„¦ resistors
- 220â„¦ resistor
- 22â„¦ resistor
